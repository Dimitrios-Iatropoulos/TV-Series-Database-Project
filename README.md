# TV-Series-Database-Project

## Project Overview

This project develops a comprehensive database for TV series, capturing details about actors, series, episodes, viewers, and their interactions. It showcases skills in SQL, database management, and data analysis within the entertainment industry context. It was developed in collaboration with Panagiotis Ioannou.

## Database Description

Our database models relationships between actors, TV series, episodes, and viewers. It includes:

- Actors: Detailed records including name, surname, gender, and contact information.
- Series & Episodes: Information on series and their episodes, including titles and production years.
- Viewers: Viewer demographics and their viewing habits.
- Viewership: Detailed viewership data, capturing which episodes are watched by which viewers.
- Below is the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) utilized for the design of our TV series database. It visually represents the database schema.
